=====================
THINGS YOU NEED TO DO
=====================
- Make sure the following line is in your base Makefile:

include boilerplate/generated-includes.mk

- Remove any other 'include' lines, unless they're for things truly
  unique to your repository. (Otherwise, consider proposing them to
  boilerplate.)

- Delete any obsolete files you're no longer including.

- Make sure you are properly integrated with codecov.io:
  https://github.com/openshift/ops-sop/blob/93d100347746ce04ad552591136818f82043c648/services/codecov.md#generate-the-codecovio-token

- Make sure your prow and app-sre pipeline configurations use the standard
  targets described in the README.
